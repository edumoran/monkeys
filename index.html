        <p>Monkeys are non-hominoid simians, generally possessing tails and consisting of about 260 known living species.</p>
        <p>Many monkey species are tree-dwelling (arboreal), although there are species that live primarily on the ground, such as baboons.</p>
        <p>Most species are also active during the day (diurnal). Monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent, particularly Old World monkeys.</p>
